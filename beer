Currently, my favorite beer is Ad Astra from Free State Brewery.  However, that changes often because there are so many great breweries in KC!
Maine has some great beer, too.  Sea Dog brewing company is one of my favorites.

If you ever get the chance, go to Belgium and sample as many different beers as you can.  They have an infinite list of Trappist beers!
